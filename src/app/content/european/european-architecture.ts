    <h2>The Legacy of European Architecture</h2>
    <p>European architecture represents a continuous dialogue between past and present, tradition and innovation. From the mathematical perfection of Greek temples to the soaring verticality of Gothic cathedrals, European architecture has shaped the built environment across continents.</p>
    
    <h2>Classical Foundations: Greek and Roman</h2>
    <p>The Parthenon in Athens (447-432 BCE) exemplifies Greek architectural principles: mathematical precision, proportional harmony, and the three orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian). The Romans adapted and expanded these principles, developing the arch, vault, and dome, as seen in the Pantheon's revolutionary concrete dome.</p>
    
    <p>Greek architecture emphasized the relationship between parts and whole, using mathematical ratios to create buildings that appeared perfectly proportioned. The Golden Ratio, discovered by the Greeks, was applied to create aesthetically pleasing proportions that continue to influence architecture today.</p>
    
    <h2>Gothic Architecture: Reaching for Heaven</h2>
    <p>Gothic architecture, emerging in 12th-century France, represents a technological and spiritual revolution. The pointed arch, ribbed vault, and flying buttress allowed buildings to reach unprecedented heights while filling interiors with light through stained glass windows.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong> (1163-1345) demonstrates the Gothic ideal: a structure that seems to defy gravity, with walls reduced to skeletal frames supporting vast expanses of colored glass. The rose windows, each a masterpiece of geometry and theology, transform light into divine narrative.</p>
    
    <p>Gothic cathedrals were designed to inspire awe and direct the gaze upward, symbolizing the soul's ascent to heaven. The vertical emphasis, combined with the play of light and shadow, creates an otherworldly atmosphere that remains powerful today.</p>
    
    <h2>Renaissance: The Rebirth of Classicism</h2>
    <p>The Renaissance (14th-17th centuries) saw a return to classical principles, but with new understanding. Filippo Brunelleschi's dome for Florence Cathedral (1420-1436) combined Roman engineering with Renaissance innovation, creating the largest masonry dome ever built without centering.</p>
    
    <p>Renaissance architecture emphasized harmony, proportion, and the human scale. Architects like Andrea Palladio codified classical principles in treatises that influenced architecture for centuries. The Villa Rotonda demonstrates the perfect synthesis of classical elements with Renaissance innovation.</p>
    
    <h2>Baroque: Drama and Movement</h2>
    <p>Baroque architecture (17th-18th centuries) embraced drama, movement, and emotional intensity. Gian Lorenzo Bernini's colonnade at St. Peter's Square in Rome creates a sense of embrace, welcoming pilgrims into the church. The use of light, shadow, and curved forms creates dynamic, theatrical spaces.</p>
    
    <p>Baroque architects used illusionistic techniques, such as forced perspective and trompe l'oeil, to create spaces that appear larger or more dramatic than they actually are. The Gesù Church in Rome exemplifies the Baroque emphasis on emotional engagement and sensory experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Neoclassical: Enlightenment Ideals</h2>
    <p>The Neoclassical movement (18th-19th centuries) reflected Enlightenment values of reason, order, and democracy. Buildings like the United States Capitol and the British Museum applied classical forms to express civic virtue and cultural achievement.</p>
    
    <p>Neoclassical architecture rejected the excesses of Baroque and Rococo, returning to the simplicity and clarity of classical forms. This style became associated with democracy, republicanism, and the ideals of the American and French revolutions.</p>
    
    <h2>Modern Movements</h2>
    <p>The 20th century brought radical innovations: Le Corbusier's "machine for living," the Bauhaus emphasis on function, and contemporary architects like Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster pushing boundaries of form and technology.</p>
    
    <p>Modernism rejected historical styles in favor of new forms appropriate to industrial society. The International Style, exemplified by Mies van der Rohe's work, emphasized simplicity, functionality, and the honest expression of materials.</p>
    
    <h2>Contemporary European Architecture</h2>
    <p>Today's European architects blend tradition with innovation. Renzo Piano's work demonstrates sensitivity to context while embracing new technologies. The Pompidou Center in Paris, designed with Richard Rogers, turned architecture inside out, exposing structural and mechanical systems.</p>
    
    <p>Sustainable design has become central to contemporary European architecture, with buildings like the Edge in Amsterdam setting new standards for energy efficiency and environmental responsibility.</p>
