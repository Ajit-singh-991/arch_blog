    <h2>African Architectural Heritage</h2>
    <p>African architecture encompasses extraordinary diversity, from the ancient pyramids of Egypt to the earth architecture of Mali, the stone cities of Zimbabwe, and contemporary innovations addressing climate and sustainability.</p>
    
    <h2>Ancient Egyptian Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2560 BCE, remained the world's tallest structure for over 3,800 years. Egyptian architecture demonstrates sophisticated understanding of mathematics, astronomy, and engineering, with structures aligned to celestial events. The pyramids were not just tombs but complex architectural achievements that required precise planning and execution.</p>
    
    <p>Egyptian architecture used massive stone blocks, creating structures that have endured for millennia. The temples at Karnak and Luxor demonstrate the scale and sophistication of Egyptian building, with columns, obelisks, and relief carvings that tell stories of gods and pharaohs.</p>
    
    <h2>Earth Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Great Mosque of Djenné in Mali represents the pinnacle of earth architecture. Built entirely of mud bricks and mud plaster, this structure requires annual maintenance by the community, creating a living tradition. The adobe architecture of the region responds perfectly to the hot, dry climate, with thick walls providing thermal mass that keeps interiors cool.</p>
    
    <p>Earth architecture in Africa demonstrates sophisticated understanding of local materials and climate. The use of mud, straw, and other natural materials creates buildings that are sustainable, affordable, and perfectly adapted to their environment. The annual replastering of the Great Mosque is a community event that maintains both the building and cultural traditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Stone Architecture</h2>
    <p>Great Zimbabwe (11th-15th centuries) demonstrates sophisticated stone construction without mortar. The massive walls, some over 11 meters high, were built using a technique called "dry stone walling," creating structures that have endured for centuries. The complex includes the Great Enclosure, the largest ancient structure in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
    
    <p>The stone architecture of Great Zimbabwe demonstrates advanced engineering and planning. The walls follow the natural contours of the land, and the structures are oriented to capture breezes and provide natural ventilation.</p>
    
    <h2>Ethiopian Rock-Hewn Churches</h2>
    <p>The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, carved from living rock in the 12th-13th centuries, represent one of the world's most remarkable architectural achievements. These 11 monolithic churches were carved downward from the rock, creating structures that are both architectural and sculptural. The churches are connected by tunnels and passages, creating a complex underground city.</p>
    
    <h2>Contemporary African Architecture</h2>
    <p>Modern African architects like Francis Kéré are creating innovative, sustainable designs that respond to local climate and culture. Kéré's work, including the Gando Primary School in Burkina Faso, uses local materials and passive cooling techniques, demonstrating how architecture can be both globally relevant and locally rooted.</p>
    
    <p>Contemporary African architecture addresses challenges of rapid urbanization, climate change, and resource constraints while drawing on traditional knowledge and materials. Architects are creating solutions that are sustainable, culturally appropriate, and economically viable.</p>
    
    <h2>Vernacular Traditions</h2>
    <p>African vernacular architecture demonstrates incredible diversity, from the thatched round houses of southern Africa to the flat-roofed adobe structures of the Sahel. Each region has developed building techniques and forms that respond to local climate, materials, and cultural practices.</p>
    
    <p>These vernacular traditions represent accumulated knowledge passed down through generations, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of local conditions and sustainable building practices.</p>
    
    <h2>Urban Architecture</h2>
    <p>African cities are developing unique architectural expressions that blend traditional and modern elements. From the Art Deco buildings of Asmara, Eritrea, to the contemporary developments in cities like Lagos and Nairobi, African urban architecture reflects both global influences and local identity.</p>

  historicalContext: 'African architecture spans millennia, from ancient Egyptian civilization (3000 BCE) through medieval kingdoms (Great Zimbabwe, Mali Empire) to contemporary innovations. Each period and region has developed unique responses to local conditions, materials, and cultural values, creating a rich and diverse architectural heritage.',
  designPhilosophy: 'Harmony with environment, use of local materials, community participation in building, climate responsiveness, architecture as expression of cultural identity and social values, and sustainable practices that work with rather than against natural systems.',
