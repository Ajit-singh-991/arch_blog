    <h2>Islamic Architectural Principles</h2>
    <p>Islamic architecture, spanning from Spain to Indonesia, represents one of the world's most sophisticated building traditions. While diverse in regional expression, it shares common principles: geometric precision, calligraphic ornamentation, and the creation of spaces that facilitate spiritual contemplation.</p>
    
    <h2>Geometric Patterns</h2>
    <p>Islamic architecture avoids representational imagery in favor of abstract geometric patterns. These designs, based on mathematical principles, create infinite patterns that suggest the infinite nature of the divine. The Alhambra in Granada demonstrates this mastery, with patterns that never repeat exactly, symbolizing the infinite nature of God's creation.</p>
    
    <p>Geometric patterns are created using compass and straightedge, following mathematical principles that create perfect symmetry. These patterns can be extended infinitely, reflecting the Islamic concept of God's infinite nature. Common patterns include stars, polygons, and interlocking designs that create complex visual rhythms.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Elements</h2>
    <p><strong>Domes:</strong> The dome represents the vault of heaven. The Hagia Sophia's massive dome (later converted to a mosque) influenced Islamic architecture for centuries, inspiring structures like the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. Domes create a sense of upward movement, directing attention toward the heavens.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Arches:</strong> The horseshoe arch, pointed arch, and multifoil arch create rhythm and visual interest while serving structural functions. The Great Mosque of Cordoba features over 850 columns supporting double arches in alternating red and white stripes, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Muqarnas:</strong> These three-dimensional decorative elements, resembling stalactites, create transitions between different architectural elements while adding visual complexity and light play. Muqarnas can transform a simple square into a complex, three-dimensional surface that seems to dissolve into geometric patterns.</p>
    
    <h2>Courtyard Design</h2>
    <p>Islamic architecture often centers around courtyards, creating oases of tranquility. The Alhambra's Court of the Lions demonstrates how water, geometry, and architecture combine to create paradisiacal spaces. Courtyards provide light, ventilation, and a connection to nature, while creating a sense of privacy and enclosure.</p>
    
    <h2>Calligraphy in Architecture</h2>
    <p>Arabic calligraphy is integrated into architectural design, with verses from the Quran forming decorative elements. The art of calligraphy transforms text into visual art, with letters flowing across surfaces in patterns that are both readable and decorative. This integration of word and architecture reflects the importance of the Quran in Islamic culture.</p>
    
    <h2>Regional Variations</h2>
    <p>From the tile work of Persian mosques to the wooden architecture of Indonesia, Islamic architecture adapts to local materials and climates while maintaining core principles. The Taj Mahal represents the fusion of Persian, Indian, and Islamic traditions, creating a structure of unparalleled beauty.</p>
    
    <p>Ottoman architecture developed the central dome mosque, while Mughal architecture in India created a unique synthesis of Islamic and local traditions. Moorish architecture in Spain and North Africa developed distinctive features like the horseshoe arch and intricate stucco decoration.</p>
    
    <h2>Light and Space</h2>
    <p>Islamic architecture uses light as a spiritual and aesthetic element. Windows are often placed high on walls, allowing light to filter down and create patterns. The interplay of light and shadow, combined with geometric patterns, creates spaces that seem to transcend the material world.</p>
    
    <h2>Contemporary Islamic Architecture</h2>
    <p>Modern Islamic architecture continues to evolve, with architects like Zaha Hadid and others creating contemporary interpretations that maintain spiritual and aesthetic principles while embracing new technologies and forms. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi demonstrates how traditional principles can be expressed in contemporary architecture.</p>

  historicalContext: 'Islamic architecture emerged in the 7th century, synthesizing Byzantine, Persian, and local traditions. It spread across three continents, adapting to diverse cultures while maintaining core principles. Key periods include the Umayyad (7th-8th centuries), Abbasid (8th-13th centuries), Ottoman (14th-20th centuries), and Mughal (16th-19th centuries) empires.',
  designPhilosophy: 'Avoidance of representational imagery, emphasis on geometric abstraction as expression of divine order, creation of contemplative spaces that facilitate spiritual experience, and integration of architecture with calligraphy and ornament to create environments that reflect the beauty and order of the divine.',
